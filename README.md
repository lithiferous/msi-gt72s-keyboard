The msi-gt72s-keyboard utility can be used to set the RGB colors for the regions
on an MSI steelseries keyboard. It has been developed for and tested on the
built-in keyboard in MSI GT72S 6QE. It can be used to set full RGB colors for
any of the regions including the logo, the touchpad and the front lights (7
regions all in all). There is no guarantee that it will do anything useful for
other models â€“ it has only been tested with the one.

The tool is inspired by and loosely based on:
